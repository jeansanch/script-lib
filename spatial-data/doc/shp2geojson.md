# shp2geojson

Since geojson files are way faster to load than shapefiles, this converter, will convert the input folder containing .shp files and their respective complementary files, into their .geojson files to the output folder.

### How to use it

1. Download the script.
2. In the same folder as the script, create a folder called "input" and a folder called "output".
3. Run the code using RStudio.
